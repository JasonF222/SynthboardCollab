# Synthboard Collab

A C# project collaboration between Jason Frantz and Stephen Nagasawa!

A feature rich synthesizer board emulator with custom animated backgrounds, preset boards, a built in dashboard, recording and playback, and more!

run the following commands in MySQL prior to attempting to use the synthbaord:

Insert INTO boards (Name, createdAt, updatedAt) Values ("Water", Now(), Now());

Insert INTO boards (Name, createdAt, updatedAt) Values ("Fire", Now(), Now());

Insert INTO boards (Name, createdAt, updatedAt) Values ("Space", Now(), Now());

Insert INTO boards (Name, createdAt, updatedAt) Values ("Classic", Now(), Now());

this will code the initial 4 boards into your DB for use in the app.
